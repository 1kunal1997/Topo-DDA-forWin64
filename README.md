Topo-DDA is a topology optimization code based on DDA that runs on GPU. The ultimate goal of this project is to do electromagnetic full-wave simulation with unprecedented speed with minimum amount of memory to meet the increasing demand of more and more complex structures in bigger scales in the field of topology optimization. Potentially, this can also greatly benefit the emerging field of machine learning for nanophotonics because of the need for huge training data set that exceeds the limit of currently available comercial electromagnetic softwares.

Much work has been done but Topo-DDA is still in its early stage of development as a user friendly software. Limitations originate from both the huge amount of development work needed as well as the fundemental limits of DDA algorithm itself, such as its nature of decreased efficiency for high-refractive-index materials. 

We have a manual that we are still working on to improve. Please check [Manual.pdf](https://github.com/Raznov/Topo-DDA-forWin64/blob/master/Topo-DDA-forWin64/Manual.pdf).
